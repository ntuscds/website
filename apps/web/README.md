## Storybook

### Introduction:

Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation.
It can be used for UI development, testing, and documentation.

The basics of Storybook can be learned from https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction

### When to use Storybook?

Stories are usually written for testing components in isolation from the main web page.

Thus, you should write stories when developing a component in the `packages/ui/components` directory.

### Starting Storybook:

Navigate to the `website/packages/ui` directory, and run:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

<br />

## How To Contribute

### Steps:

1. In the main branch, run `git pull` to get the latest changes.
2. Create a new branch by running `git checkout -b web/[task-type]/SCSE-[task_number]`. Work on your task/feature in this branch.
3. After you are done with all your changes, `git add .` and `git commit -m "commit message"` to commit your changes locally.
4. Next, run `git pull origin main --rebase` to fetch new changes in the main branch (if any). Fix merge conflicts if any.
5. Push your branch to GitHub by running `git push` or `git push --set-upstream origin [branch-name]` (if this branch does not exist on GitHub)
6. Go to this GitHub repo and make a pull request from your branch to `main` branch. Name the PR starting with `[SCSE-branch_number]` (e.g.: [SCSE-125] Add web docs).
7. Ensure that all automated checks passes. Fix any errors that occurs.
8. Request 1 person to review your pull request, and you are done!

## Tests

**1. Jest Unit Tests**

All Jest unit tests are written in the `_tests_` directory with `test.tsx` and `snapshot.tsx` extension.

To run jest unit tests, run:

```bash
yarn test
```

**Note: Snapshots need to be updated after changes have been made to the pages. This can be achieved by running:**

```bash
yarn test -u
```

<br />

**2. Cypress E2E Tests**

All Cypress tests are written in the `cypress/e2e` directory with the extension `.cy.ts`.

To begin cypress e2e test, run the following command to open the UI:

```bash
yarn cypress
```
